// into a fixture result (goals + outcome).
//
// Combines two layers:
//   1. Goal thresholds — each team's absolute score → goal count
//   2. Smoothing rules — converts unfair edge cases into draws
//      to absorb sub-1.5pt noise that would otherwise decide a match
//
// Used uniformly by Campionato and Battle Royal so a given pair of
// scores always produces the same result regardless of competition.
